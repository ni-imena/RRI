# Virtual Runner 

## Overview

Virtual Runner is a versatile and interactive application/game developed using the LibGDX framework. This application allows users to visualize, analyze, and draw their runs onto a tiled map. With the added feature of a custom programming language, users can describe and share their runs in a unique and expressive way.

## Features

### 1. Tiled Map Visualization

Virtual Runner provides users with a visually appealing way to represent their runs on a tiled map. The map serves as a canvas for users to draw and plan their routes, adding a dynamic and engaging element to their running experience.
